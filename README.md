# Phd_thesis_exp

The repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks for my experiments in my PhD thesis and the source code for the methods I used to run.


* **Title**: Integrative Co-Expressed Gene Network Analysis for Bladder Cancer Subtyping Using Multi-Omics Data
* **Supervisors**: Dr A Mason, Dr D Halliday, Prof J Southgate, Prof S Smith
* **Departments**:  School of Physics, Engineering and Technology \& Department of Biology, University of York 

# Notebooks

Thre are three main folders for my notebooks each corresponding to a chapter in my thesis:
 * `clustering_analysis` - chapter 3
 * `network_I` - chapter 4 and 5
 * `network_II` - chapter 6

The methods are described at length in my thesis which will be available on the white roses databases after the Viva and corrections.


# Source code

* `pgcna3.py` - the modified version of the PGCNA work from Care et al. (2019). This is the script used to generate the networks in chapter 4
* `iNet/` - represents the code for iNet and contains the network generated in chapter 6
* `playground.py` - how to run the iNet package
* `NetworkAnalysis` - suit of scripts used to analyse the networks generated
